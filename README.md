# YouTube-Live-Translating-Extension
* This is my attempt of building a Google Chrome extension in an effort to interact with non-English speakers streamers on YouTube Live
* This is a Work In Progress

# Current Progress So Far
Successfully able to retrieve messages from YouTube Live Chat and sending the messages back into the extension 
May 4th Update - Successfully connect to the DeepL API, allowing for flawless auto translation based on language detected
May 20th Update - Successfully running translation instance for Libre Translate, allowing users without an paid API such as DeepL to use the extension
# Current Plan for the Project
* Touch up the UI
* Publish somewhere to get people to test it
* PUBLISH IT ONTO THE GOOGLE EXTENSION PAGE
